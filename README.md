# TiniJS Core 

The core of the TiniJS framework.

## Doppelgangers

**The concept: provide the similar syntax for developers from other frameworks.**

There are several ways of using the TiniJS framework:

- `Default`: for new developers and Lit developers and any developers ([see more](./src/README.md)).
- `Angular`: same as the *Default*, but it has a project structure similar to Angular ([see more](./angular/README.md)).
- `Vue`: similar to the Vue SFC syntax and it has a NuxtJS structure ([see more](./vue/README.md)).
- `React`: similar to a NextJS project ([see more](./react/README.md)).
- `Svelte`: similar to a SvelteKit project ([see more](./svelte/README.md)).

There may be more with the same concept.
